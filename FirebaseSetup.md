I' ve learnt the concept of Firebase Services and Real-Time Data Integration where we connected our Flutter app to Firebase to learn how Firebase supports login, database storage, file uploads, and real time updates. We've set up Firebase by creating a project on the Firebase Console, adding our Flutter Android app, and downloaded the 'google-services.json' file. Later, we added required Firebase packages such as 'firebase_core', 'cloud_firestore', in the 'pubspec.yaml' file and initialized Firebase in main.dart and we also explored Firebase Authentication to let users sign up and log in using email and password.

We also used Cloud Firestore to store and update data in real time. When new data is added, it appears instantly on all devices without refreshing the screen. We tested this live behaviour using 'StreamBuilder', which shows automatic updates.
