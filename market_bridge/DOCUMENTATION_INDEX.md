## 🎯 Key Points to Remember

1. **Always use filtration flow** - All searches go through _filterAndSortOrders()
2. **StateBuilder for real-time** - Uses Firebase streams, not snapshots
3. **Tab-specific logic** - Different tabs have different queries
4. **Selection is client-side** - Stored in _selectedOrders Set
5. **Analytics are calculated** - Not stored, computed from data
6. **Colors are consistent** - Blue theme throughout
7. **Responsive by design** - Works on mobile and tablet
8. **Error handling included** - Null checks and try-catch blocks
