# 🧩 Flutter Widget Tree & Reactive UI Demo

This demo application is built using **Flutter** to demonstrate the core concepts of:
- Widget Tree hierarchy
- Flutter’s reactive UI model
- Efficient UI rebuilding using the widget tree

This project focuses on understanding how Flutter builds, updates, and optimizes the UI using widgets rather than traditional imperative UI updates.

---

## 📱 Demo App Overview

The app demonstrates a simple interactive UI where:
- Widgets are structured in a clear hierarchy
- UI updates occur automatically when state changes
- Only affected parts of the widget tree are rebuilt

This helps in understanding **how Flutter manages UI efficiently**.

---


### Key Points:
- `MaterialApp` is the root widget
- `Scaffold` provides basic UI structure
- UI elements are composed using nested widgets
- Each widget is immutable and describes part of the UI

---


## 📖 Concept Explanation

### ✅ What is a Widget Tree?

A **Widget Tree** is a hierarchical structure that represents the entire UI of a Flutter application.

- Every UI element in Flutter is a widget
- Widgets are nested inside other widgets
- The widget tree defines **how UI components are laid out and related**

Flutter uses this tree to understand:
- What to display
- How widgets are connected
- Which parts need rebuilding

---

### Key Learnings

- Flutter UI is built entirely using widgets
- The widget tree defines structure and layout
- Flutter’s reactive model simplifies UI updates
- Partial rebuilds improve performance
- Understanding widget hierarchy is critical for clean UI design


## Market Bridge – Multi-Screen Navigation (Sprint-2)

This project demonstrates **multi-screen navigation in Flutter** using `Navigator`, named routes, and dynamic route arguments. The app includes authentication screens, profile completion, and a responsive home screen inspired by the Market-Bridge use case.

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### ✅ **1. Splash Screen → Phone Login → OTP → Profile → Home**

Navigation flow implemented using:

* `Navigator.pushNamed()`
* `Navigator.pushReplacementNamed()`
* `onGenerateRoute` for screens that require arguments
* Centralized `routes.dart` file

### ✅ **2. Firebase Phone Authentication**

* Sends OTP using `FirebaseAuth.verifyPhoneNumber`
* Auto-verification supported
* Manual OTP entry and validation
* Routes forward necessary data (phone, role, verificationId)

### ✅ **3. Profile Completion Page**

* Saves data to Firestore
* Collects: Name, Email, Location, Language, Farm Size
* Shows a success popup and routes to Home screen

### ✅ **4. Responsive Farmer Home UI**

* Shows sample produce cards and quick actions

---

## 🧭 Navigation Structure

| Route Name  | Screen                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/`         | SplashScreen                             |
| `/phone`    | PhoneLoginScreen                         |
| `/otp`      | OtpVerifyScreen *(with arguments)*       |
| `/complete` | CompleteProfileScreen *(with arguments)* |
| `/home`     | ResponsiveHome                           |

---

## 📂 Project Files (Key Screens)

* `lib/main.dart` → App entry + route configuration
* `lib/routes.dart` → All route constants
* `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`
* `lib/screens/phone_login_screen.dart`
* `lib/screens/otp_verify_screen.dart`
* `lib/screens/complete_profile_screen.dart`
* `lib/screens/responsive_home.dart`
* `lib/services/auth_service.dart` → Handles OTP login

---


## Reflection 

Using named routes improved readability and organization of the navigation system.
`onGenerateRoute` was helpful for passing dynamic data like `verificationId` and `phoneNumber` to OTP and profile screens.
This structure scales well as the project grows.
